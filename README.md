# Visual-Studio-2010-Express-Install-Helper
The objective of this installer is to simplify the installation of Visual Studio 2010 (Express) for new students who don't know how to extract Microsoft's ISO file. 
<br>The script itself is written in NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) Modern UI.

      I just wrote this small wrapper to make it easier for first time students to get started.
